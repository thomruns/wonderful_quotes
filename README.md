# Wonderful Quotes
A project based on M Schwartzmuller Udemy VueJS course
This small project uses VueJS components to construct an app that permits the user to add up to 10 quotes to the interface. A progress bar is displayed to show how many quotes of the maximum have been entered. When the maximum number has been reached, an alert advises the user to delete a quote to add more.
This project uses Bootstrap for styling purposes.
The project purpose was to reinforce the concepts of components, slots, two-way data binding, custom events and event listeners, as implemented by VueJS.
